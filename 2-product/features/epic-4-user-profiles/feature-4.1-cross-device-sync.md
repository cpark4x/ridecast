# Feature 4.1: Cross-Device Sync

### Epic Context

**Parent Epic:** [Epic 4: User Profiles & Preferences](../../epics/epic-4-user-profiles.md)
**Epic Objective:** Enable users to manage accounts and sync across devices

---

### Feature Overview

**What:** Real-time synchronization of library, playback progress, and preferences across all user devices with conflict resolution and offline support.

**Why:** Users with multiple devices (phone, tablet, CarPlay) need seamless access to their content and ability to resume exactly where they left off on any device.

**Success Criteria:**
- Library syncs within 30 seconds across devices
- Progress syncs with <30 second latency
- 99.9%+ sync reliability
- Offline changes sync when reconnected

### Technical Requirements

**Authentication:**
- User account creation and login
- JWT-based authentication
- Refresh token mechanism
- OAuth support (Google, Apple Sign-In)
- Session management across devices

**Data Sync:**
- Library metadata sync
- Playback progress sync
- User preferences sync (voices, settings)
- Queue sync (optional)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Fallback to polling if WebSocket fails

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Most recent timestamp wins
- Handle offline edits on multiple devices
- Graceful merge of library changes
- User notification of conflicts (if needed)

**Offline Support:**
- Track changes while offline
- Queue sync operations
- Sync when reconnected
- Handle sync failures gracefully

**Privacy & Security:**
- Encrypt data in transit (HTTPS)
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- User controls for data sharing
- GDPR/CCPA compliance
- Data export capability

**Performance:**
- Efficient delta sync (only changes)
- Batch sync operations
- Background sync
- Minimal battery impact

### Dependencies

- **Blocks:** All features benefit from sync
- **Blocked by:** Backend infrastructure (auth, database, sync service)
- **Related:** All features that store user data
