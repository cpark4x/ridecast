# Epic 1: Audio Creation

---

### Problem Statement

Commuters have books, articles, and documents they want to read but no time to sit and read them. Existing audiobooks are expensive (often $20-30 per title), have limited availability (not all books have audio versions), and offer no control over narration voice or style. Users need a way to convert their existing reading backlog into high-quality audio that they can listen to during their commute.

---

### Objective

Enable users to convert any text-based content (EPUB, PDF, TXT, web articles) into high-quality, AI-generated audio narration that's ready for listening during their commute, with completion time under 5 minutes for typical chapters and a 95%+ success rate.

---

### Business Value

- **Core Value Proposition**: This is THE fundamental feature of Ridecast - without it, there is no product
- **Market Differentiation**: Most competitors only support specific formats or have poor audio quality
- **Revenue Driver**: Conversion capability is what users pay for (freemium model potential)
- **User Retention**: High-quality conversions lead to satisfied users who convert their entire reading backlog
- **Network Effects**: Users share converted content recommendations, driving word-of-mouth growth

---

### Scope

**In-Scope:**

- Text extraction from EPUB, PDF, TXT formats
- Web article conversion via URL input
- AI voice synthesis integration (Azure Neural TTS or ElevenLabs)
- Chapter/section detection and segmentation
- Audio file generation with metadata (chapter markers, ID3 tags)
- Background processing with progress tracking
- Error handling and retry logic with user feedback
- Queue system for multiple conversions
- Storage of generated audio files

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Video content conversion (future consideration)
- Real-time streaming generation (batch processing only for MVP)
- Custom voice cloning (future premium feature)
- Multi-language support (English only for MVP)
- OCR for scanned PDFs (future enhancement)
- Audiobook-style production with music and sound effects

### Features

This epic comprises the following features:

1. [Feature 1.1: Text-to-Speech Conversion](../features/epic-1-audio-creation/feature-1.1-text-to-speech-conversion.md) - Core conversion pipeline from text to audio with support for multiple input formats

---

### Success Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**

- **Conversion Success Rate**: Target >95% of uploads result in playable audio
- **Conversion Speed**: Target <5 minutes for 30-page document (5,000 words)
- **Audio Quality Rating**: Target 4.5+ stars average user rating
- **Format Support**: 3+ input formats supported (EPUB, PDF, TXT)

**Secondary Metrics:**

- User Satisfaction: >80% of users satisfied with converted audio quality
- Completion Rate: >70% of users complete their first conversion
- Repeat Usage: >60% of users convert additional content after first success
- Error Recovery Rate: >90% of failed conversions succeed on retry

**How We'll Measure:**

- Track conversion job status (success/failure) in database
- Log conversion duration per document
- In-app rating prompt after first playback
- Analytics events for upload, conversion start, conversion complete, and first play
- User surveys and feedback collection

---

### User Personas

**Primary Users:**

- **Daily Commuter (Emma, 32)** - Drives 45 minutes each way, has a Kindle full of unread books, wants to make productive use of drive time without distraction
- **Knowledge Worker (David, 28)** - Wants to stay current with technical articles and industry blogs during his commute, prefers audio for multitasking
- **Student (Alex, 21)** - Needs to get through required reading while commuting to campus, audiobooks help retention

**Secondary Users:**

- **Long-Distance Driver** - Road trips and travel, wants to convert travel guides or novels for entertainment
- **Accessibility User** - Needs audio versions of documents for vision impairment or learning differences

---

### Dependencies

**Technical Dependencies:**

- TTS API selection and integration (see [StackDecisionLog.md](../../4-technology/StackDecisionLog.md))
- Cloud storage infrastructure (S3 or Google Cloud Storage)
- Job queue system (Redis Queue or AWS SQS)
- Text parsing libraries (epub.js, pdf.js, PyPDF2)

**Product Dependencies:**

- **Requires:** None (this is the foundational epic)
- **Enables:**
  - Epic 2: Voice System (voice selection happens during conversion)
  - Epic 3: Library & Playback (generated audio to play)
  - Epic 4: User Profiles (content to sync across devices)
  - Epic 5: Car Mode (audio to listen to while driving)

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk               | Impact       | Probability  | Mitigation Strategy    |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| TTS API costs too high | High | Medium | Implement deduplication (same book + voice = reuse audio), negotiate volume discounts, consider hybrid approach with multiple APIs |
| Poor audio quality | High | Low | Evaluate multiple TTS providers during selection, implement quality testing pipeline, allow users to regenerate with different voice |
| Slow conversion speed | Medium | Medium | Optimize chunking strategy, use parallel processing for long documents, set realistic user expectations with time estimates |
| Copyright concerns | High | Medium | Focus on personal use only, implement DMCA takedown process, educate users on legal use, consider publisher partnerships |
| Text extraction failures | Medium | High | Test with diverse documents during development, implement robust error handling, provide clear error messages with suggestions |

---

### Timeline

**Estimated Duration:** 8-10 weeks for full epic

**Phases:**

1. **Phase 1: Core Pipeline (4 weeks)** - Text extraction + basic TTS integration
2. **Phase 2: Quality & Scale (2 weeks)** - Improve audio quality, optimize processing speed
3. **Phase 3: Polish (2-4 weeks)** - Error handling, progress tracking, notifications, testing

**Key Milestones:**

- Week 2: TTS API selected and integrated with test implementation
- Week 4: First successful EPUB â†’ Audio conversion end-to-end
- Week 6: Support for PDF and TXT formats added
- Week 8: Background processing and notifications working
- Week 10: 95%+ success rate achieved, ready for MVP launch

### Open Questions

- [ ] Which TTS API offers the best quality-to-cost ratio? (Azure vs ElevenLabs vs Google)
- [ ] How do we handle very large files (500+ page books)? Streaming? Chunking strategy?
- [ ] Should we implement audio caching/deduplication across users for popular books?
- [ ] What's our content policy for copyrighted material? Personal use only?
- [ ] Do we need to support DRM-protected EPUBs?
- [ ] Should we allow editing/correcting text before conversion?
- [ ] What file size limits should we set (if any)?
