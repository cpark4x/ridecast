# Epic 1: Audio Creation

## Overview
Enable users to convert any text-based content (books, articles, PDFs, documents) into high-quality, AI-generated audio that's ready for listening.

## Goals
- Accept multiple content input formats (EPUB, PDF, TXT, URLs)
- Generate human-quality audio narration
- Process content efficiently (target: <5 min for typical book chapter)
- Maintain 95%+ success rate for audio generation

## Scope

### In Scope
- Text extraction from common formats
- AI voice synthesis with natural prosody
- Chapter/section detection and segmentation
- Audio file generation and storage
- Progress tracking during generation
- Error handling and retry logic

### Out of Scope (for v1)
- Video content conversion
- Real-time streaming generation
- Custom voice cloning
- Multi-language support

## User Stories
- US1: Convert Book to Audio
- US2: Select Voice and Tone

## Success Criteria
- Users can upload content in 3+ formats
- >95% successful audio generation rate
- Audio quality rated 4.5+ stars
- Average generation time <5 minutes for 30-page document

## Technical Considerations
- AI/ML voice synthesis API selection (ElevenLabs, Azure, Google?)
- Text preprocessing and cleaning pipeline
- Asynchronous job processing
- Storage optimization for large audio files

## Dependencies
- Voice synthesis API partnership/selection
- Cloud storage infrastructure
- Content parsing libraries

## Timeline Estimate
- MVP: 4-6 weeks
- Full feature set: 8-10 weeks
