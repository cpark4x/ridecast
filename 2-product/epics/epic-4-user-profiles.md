# Epic 4: User Profiles & Preferences

---

### Problem Statement

Users invest time converting content and building their library, but without an account system, their data is locked to a single device. When they upgrade phones, switch to a tablet for weekend trips, or use CarPlay in the car, they lose access to their content and progress. Additionally, users have preferences (favorite voices, playback speed, etc.) that should follow them everywhere. Users need a frictionless way to create an account and automatically sync their entire experience across all their devices.

---

### Objective

Enable users to create accounts in under 2 minutes, automatically sync their library and playback progress across all devices with <30 second latency, store and sync preferences, and provide full data privacy controls - all while maintaining 99.9%+ reliability and GDPR/CCPA compliance.

---

### Business Value

- **User Retention**: Accounts dramatically increase retention (users don't want to lose their library)
- **Multi-Device Usage**: Users who sync become power users across phone, tablet, CarPlay
- **Data Insights**: Anonymized usage data helps improve the product
- **Monetization Foundation**: Accounts enable subscription tiers and premium features
- **Trust Building**: Strong privacy controls build user confidence and brand reputation

---

### Scope

**In-Scope:**

- User registration (email/password, OAuth with Google/Apple)
- Simple login flow with "Remember Me" option
- Profile management (name, email, password change, avatar)
- Preference storage and sync (voice choices, playback speed, auto-download settings)
- Library metadata sync across devices (which books, progress, completion status)
- Playback progress sync (real-time, <30 second latency)
- Listening history and basic statistics (time listened, books completed)
- Privacy settings (data sharing preferences, delete account)
- Data export capability (GDPR requirement)

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Social features like friends, following, social feed (future)
- Public user profiles (future)
- Achievements, badges, or gamification (future)
- Family sharing plans (future premium feature)
- Two-factor authentication (future security enhancement)

---

### Features

This epic comprises the following features:

1. [Feature 4.1: Cross-Device Sync](../features/epic-4-user-profiles/feature-4.1-cross-device-sync.md) - Real-time sync of library, progress, and preferences across all user devices

---

### Success Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**

- **Account Creation Time**: <2 minutes from start to finish
- **Sync Latency**: Library and progress sync within 30 seconds
- **Auth Reliability**: 99.9%+ successful logins
- **Compliance**: 100% GDPR/CCPA compliant

**Secondary Metrics:**

- Account Adoption: >60% of users create accounts within first week
- Multi-Device Usage: >40% of accounts used on 2+ devices
- Sync Success Rate: >99% of sync attempts succeed
- Data Export Requests: Track volume (should be low, indicates trust)

**How We'll Measure:**

- Track registration funnel (started, completed, drop-off points)
- Monitor sync latency and success rates
- Log authentication attempts and failures
- Survey users on privacy concerns and trust
- Track multi-device usage patterns

---

### User Personas

**Primary Users:**

- **Multi-Device Owner (Jennifer, 34)** - Has iPhone, iPad, and CarPlay-enabled car, wants seamless experience across all three
- **Device Upgrader (Marcus, 29)** - Upgrades phones annually, needs easy migration of his library and preferences
- **Privacy-Conscious User (Sarah, 41)** - Concerned about data privacy, needs transparency and control

**Secondary Users:**

- **Casual User** - Uses one device, but values cloud backup "just in case"
- **Family Sharer** - Eventually wants to share subscriptions (out of scope for v1 but future consideration)

---

### Dependencies

**Technical Dependencies:**

- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud, or similar)
- Database for user data (PostgreSQL)
- Authentication service (Firebase Auth, Auth0, or custom JWT)
- Real-time sync mechanism (WebSocket or polling)
- Encryption for data at rest and in transit

**Product Dependencies:**

- **Requires**: Epic 3: Library & Playback (need library and progress data to sync)
- **Enables**: Future premium features, subscription tiers, social features

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk               | Impact       | Probability  | Mitigation Strategy    |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Privacy concerns scare users away | High | Low | Clear, simple privacy policy; prominent data controls; build trust through transparency |
| Sync conflicts (edited on 2 devices offline) | Medium | Medium | Implement conflict resolution (most recent wins); test thoroughly; rare but handle gracefully |
| Authentication service downtime | High | Low | Choose reliable provider (99.9%+ SLA); have status page; graceful degradation (cached auth) |
| Data breach | Critical | Very Low | Strong encryption; regular security audits; follow OWASP best practices; incident response plan |
| Compliance violations (GDPR/CCPA) | Critical | Low | Legal review of policies; implement required features (data export, deletion); regular compliance audits |

---

### Timeline

**Estimated Duration:** 5-6 weeks for full epic

**Phases:**

1. **Phase 1: Auth Foundation (2 weeks)** - Registration, login, password reset, JWT implementation
2. **Phase 2: Profile & Preferences (1 week)** - Profile management, preference storage and sync
3. **Phase 3: Data Sync (2 weeks)** - Library and progress sync with conflict resolution
4. **Phase 4: Privacy & Compliance (1 week)** - Privacy controls, data export, compliance review

**Key Milestones:**

- Week 2: Authentication working with social OAuth options
- Week 3: User profiles and preferences syncing
- Week 5: Full library and progress sync operational
- Week 6: Privacy features complete, compliance verified, ready for launch

### Open Questions

- [ ] Which authentication provider? (Firebase Auth vs Auth0 vs custom JWT)
- [ ] Should we support social login only (no email/password)?
- [ ] How do we handle sync conflicts beyond "most recent wins"?
- [ ] What user data do we actually need to collect (minimize)?
- [ ] Should profile avatars be supported or just initials?
- [ ] Do we need email verification or can users skip it?
- [ ] What's the account deletion flow (immediate vs 30-day grace period)?
