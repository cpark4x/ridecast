# Epic 3: Library & Playback

---

### Problem Statement

Users convert content to audio but then need a reliable way to organize, access, and play it - especially during their commute when they may have spotty or no internet connection. Existing audio apps often require connectivity, don't remember exact playback position, or have clunky interfaces unsuitable for driving. Users need an offline-first library system with flawless playback and intelligent progress tracking that works seamlessly whether they're at home on WiFi or driving through rural areas.

---

### Objective

Build a robust, offline-first audio library and playback system that organizes converted content, tracks progress to the second, enables smart queue management, and provides seamless cross-device sync - all while maintaining 99.5%+ reliability and working perfectly without internet connection.

---

### Business Value

- **Core Retention Driver**: If playback doesn't work flawlessly, users abandon the app
- **Offline-First = Reliability**: Commuters often have poor connectivity; offline capability is critical
- **Progress Tracking = Convenience**: Users can seamlessly switch between devices
- **Queue Management = Engagement**: Pre-loaded queues increase session length
- **Foundation for Growth**: Solid playback infrastructure enables all future features

---

### Scope

**In-Scope:**

- Audio library UI with metadata (title, author, cover art, duration, progress)
- Playback engine with controls (play/pause, skip forward/back, scrub, speed adjust)
- Progress tracking to the exact second with auto-save
- Offline playback after download (no buffering, no connection required)
- Download management system with background downloads
- Queue/playlist creation and management
- Background audio playback (continues when app backgrounded)
- Lock screen media controls
- CarPlay/Android Auto integration
- Cross-device progress sync

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Social sharing features (future)
- Collaborative/shared playlists (future)
- Advanced search and filtering (MVP has basic search only)
- Bookmarks and highlights within audio (future)
- Sleep timer (future enhancement)
- Podcasts or streaming content (books/articles only for MVP)

### Features

This epic comprises the following features:

1. [Feature 3.1: Playback Queue](../features/epic-3-library-playback/feature-3.1-playback-queue.md) - Queue management with reordering and auto-play
2. [Feature 3.2: Offline Playback](../features/epic-3-library-playback/feature-3.2-offline-playback.md) - Download system and offline playback with storage management

---

### Success Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**

- **Playback Reliability**: 99.5%+ uptime with <0.1% playback errors
- **Resume Performance**: <2 seconds to resume from exact position
- **Offline Capability**: 100% of downloaded content plays offline without issues
- **Sync Latency**: Progress syncs across devices within 30 seconds
- **Download Success**: >98% of downloads complete successfully

**Secondary Metrics:**

- Queue Usage: >50% of users create multi-item queues
- Download Adoption: >70% of users download content for offline
- Background Playback: >90% of listening happens with app backgrounded
- Session Length: Average 25-45 minutes (matching commute duration)
- Completion Rate: >60% of started books are completed

**How We'll Measure:**

- Track playback errors and crashes in real-time
- Log resume time performance
- Monitor offline playback attempts and success rate
- Track sync latency and conflicts
- Analytics for queue creation, downloads, and session duration

---

### User Personas

**Primary Users:**

- **Reliable Commuter (Tom, 38)** - Drives same route daily, needs content to work every time without fiddling, frustrated by buffering or connection issues
- **Multi-Device User (Rachel, 31)** - Listens on phone, tablet, and CarPlay, wants seamless handoff between devices
- **Offline-First User (David, 45)** - Rural commute with poor cell coverage, must have downloaded content

**Secondary Users:**

- **Queue Builder** - Likes to prepare listening lineup for the week
- **Binge Listener** - Listens to entire books in sequence

---

### Dependencies

**Technical Dependencies:**

- Audio player framework (AVFoundation for iOS, ExoPlayer for Android)
- Local database (CoreData/Room) for library and progress
- Background task system for downloads
- Cloud sync infrastructure for progress tracking
- CarPlay/Android Auto SDKs and certification

**Product Dependencies:**

- **Requires:** Epic 1: Audio Creation (need audio files to play and manage)
- **Enables:**
  - Epic 4: User Profiles (syncing library and progress)
  - Epic 5: Car Mode (car-optimized playback controls)

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk               | Impact       | Probability  | Mitigation Strategy    |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Playback errors/crashes | Critical | Medium | Extensive testing across devices, robust error handling, graceful degradation, monitoring and alerts |
| Poor offline sync handling | High | Medium | Queue offline changes, conflict resolution algorithm (most recent wins), test offline scenarios thoroughly |
| Storage management issues | Medium | High | Smart cleanup recommendations, user warnings before running out of space, efficient storage algorithms |
| CarPlay/Android Auto certification delays | High | Low | Start certification process early, follow guidelines strictly, have fallback plan without certification |
| Background download battery drain | Medium | Medium | Use platform-native background APIs, download only on WiFi by default, monitor battery impact |

---

### Timeline

**Estimated Duration:** 10-12 weeks for full epic

**Phases:**

1. **Phase 1: Core Playback (3 weeks)** - Audio player, basic controls, progress tracking
2. **Phase 2: Offline System (3 weeks)** - Download management, offline playback, storage management
3. **Phase 3: Queue & Library (2 weeks)** - Queue management, library UI, search
4. **Phase 4: Sync & CarPlay (3 weeks)** - Cross-device sync, CarPlay/Android Auto integration
5. **Phase 5: Polish & Testing (1-2 weeks)** - Bug fixes, performance optimization, reliability testing

**Key Milestones:**

- Week 3: Basic playback working with progress tracking
- Week 6: Offline downloads and playback functional
- Week 8: Queue management complete
- Week 11: CarPlay/Android Auto integration complete
- Week 12: 99.5%+ reliability achieved, ready for launch

### Open Questions

- [ ] Should we support streaming (online playback without download) as fallback?
- [ ] How do we handle very large libraries (1000+ books)?
- [ ] What's the right storage cleanup algorithm (LRU, user-driven, both)?
- [ ] Should queue sync across devices or remain device-specific?
- [ ] Do we need folder/collection organization in addition to playlists?
- [ ] How do we handle interrupted downloads (resume or restart)?
- [ ] Should we support chapter-level downloads for large books?
