# Epic 2: Voice System

---

### Problem Statement

While text-to-speech technology has improved dramatically, not all voices are created equal, and personal preference plays a huge role in listening enjoyment. Users may find one narrator voice grating while loving another. Additionally, different content types benefit from different narration styles - technical books need clear, professional voices while fiction benefits from more expressive, storytelling voices. Users need the ability to choose and customize their audio narrator to match both their preferences and their content.

---

### Objective

Provide users with a curated selection of 5+ high-quality AI voices with distinct characteristics, enable instant preview of each voice, and remember user preferences to create a personalized audio experience that increases engagement and satisfaction.

---

### Business Value

- **Differentiation**: Most TTS apps offer limited or no voice choice - this sets us apart
- **User Satisfaction**: Voice choice directly impacts listening enjoyment and retention
- **Personalization**: Remembered preferences show we care about individual user needs
- **Reduce Churn**: Users who find their perfect voice are more likely to stay engaged
- **Premium Tier Opportunity**: Additional premium voices could be a monetization path

---

### Scope

**In-Scope:**

- Voice library with minimum 5 distinct voices (varied by gender, accent, age, style)
- Voice preview/sample playback (15-30 second samples)
- Per-book voice selection during conversion
- Voice preference memory (per user, per content type)
- Playback speed controls (0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x)
- Natural-sounding speed adjustment without pitch distortion
- Voice metadata (name, description, characteristics, use cases)
- Voice recommendations based on content type

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Custom voice cloning from user recordings (future premium feature)
- Real-time voice switching mid-playback (technical limitation)
- Voice effects like reverb, EQ, or audio processing (beyond speed)
- Emotional tone adjustment per scene (future AI enhancement)
- User-generated or community voices (future consideration)

### Features

This epic comprises the following features:

1. [Feature 2.1: Voice Selection](../features/epic-2-voice-system/feature-2.1-voice-selection.md) - Voice browsing, preview, and selection interface with preference management

---

### Success Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**

- **Voice Count**: 5+ high-quality voices available at launch
- **User Satisfaction**: >80% of users satisfied with voice options
- **Preview Performance**: Voice preview plays in <2 seconds
- **Preference Persistence**: Voice preferences persist across sessions for 100% of users

**Secondary Metrics:**

- Voice Discovery: >70% of users preview at least 2 voices before selecting
- Voice Diversity Usage: No single voice accounts for >50% of conversions (shows good variety)
- Speed Control Usage: >30% of users adjust playback speed
- Re-generation Rate: <10% of users regenerate with different voice (indicates good first choice)

**How We'll Measure:**

- Track voice selection events and which voices are chosen
- Log preview interactions (which voices previewed, how many)
- Survey users after first conversion about voice satisfaction
- Track playback speed adjustments
- Monitor voice regeneration requests

---

### User Personas

**Primary Users:**

- **Picky Listener (Sarah, 35)** - Very particular about voice quality, will abandon audiobooks with annoying narrators, needs to find "her voice"
- **Content Matcher (Michael, 29)** - Wants different voices for different content types (professional for business books, warm for fiction)
- **Speed Reader (Lisa, 42)** - Listens at 1.5-2x speed to maximize content consumption, needs clear enunciation

**Secondary Users:**

- **Accessibility User** - May have specific voice preferences based on hearing or processing needs
- **Non-Native Speaker** - May prefer slower speeds and clearer articulation

---

### Dependencies

**Technical Dependencies:**

- TTS API with multiple voice options (Azure, ElevenLabs, etc.)
- Audio processing library for speed adjustment without pitch change
- CDN for hosting voice preview samples
- User preference storage in database

**Product Dependencies:**

- **Requires:** Epic 1: Audio Creation (voice selection happens during conversion process)
- **Enables:** Better user experience across all audio playback features

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk               | Impact       | Probability  | Mitigation Strategy    |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Limited voice options from API | High | Low | Evaluate multiple TTS providers, choose one with 10+ voices, curate best 5-8 for launch |
| Users don't like any voices | High | Low | Test with beta users before launch, have backup API option, continuously evaluate new voices |
| Preview samples sound different than final audio | Medium | Medium | Generate preview samples using same pipeline as production, use consistent text for all previews |
| Speed adjustment degrades quality | Medium | Low | Use high-quality audio processing library (not simple pitch shifting), test at all speed levels |
| Voice preferences don't sync | Low | Low | Implement robust preference sync system, test across devices before launch |

---

### Timeline

**Estimated Duration:** 4-5 weeks for full epic

**Phases:**

1. **Phase 1: Voice Library Setup (1 week)** - Evaluate and select 5+ voices from TTS API, generate preview samples
2. **Phase 2: UI Implementation (2 weeks)** - Build voice selection interface, preview playback, preference storage
3. **Phase 3: Speed Controls (1 week)** - Implement playback speed adjustment without quality loss
4. **Phase 4: Polish & Testing (1 week)** - User testing, refinements, performance optimization

**Key Milestones:**

- Week 1: Voice library finalized with 5+ curated voices and preview samples
- Week 3: Voice selection UI complete and functional
- Week 4: Speed controls working without audio degradation
- Week 5: Beta testing complete, ready for launch

### Open Questions

- [ ] Should we offer more voices (10+) or keep it curated (5-8)?
- [ ] How do we handle voice availability changes from the TTS API?
- [ ] Should users be able to rate/review voices?
- [ ] Do we need different voices for different languages (future)?
- [ ] Should we allow voice preview with user's actual content text?
- [ ] What's the right balance of voice variety vs. overwhelming choice?
- [ ] Should speed controls be per-book or global preference?
