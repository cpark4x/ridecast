## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Spotify-inspired library redesign** with professional table layout
  - Clean table structure with column headers: # | TITLE | AUTHOR | STATUS | DURATION
  - Single green accent color (#1DB954) for play button
  - Hover-based action buttons (convert, download, compress, delete)
  - Gray color scheme for secondary actions
  - Improved information density with compact rows
  - Play button appears on hover in the number column for converted items
  - Action icons appear on the right side on row hover

- **User-friendly compression panel**
  - Changed button labels from technical percentages (20%, 40%, 60%) to clear options:
    - "Quick Summary" (save ~20% time)
    - "Main Points" (save ~40% time)
    - "Essential Only" (save ~60% time)
  - Display time estimates instead of word counts ("4 min listening time" vs "637 words")
  - Show time savings ("~31 min shorter" instead of "Saved 4,669 words")
  - Added descriptive badges explaining each compression level
  - Success message shows actual time saved and new listening duration

### Fixed
- **Backend compression response format**
