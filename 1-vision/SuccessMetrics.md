## Anti-Metrics

Metrics we explicitly **do not** optimize for:

- **Time Spent in App (Outside Playback)**: We want minimal UI friction
- **Number of Features Used**: Simplicity > feature usage
- **Notification Click Rate**: We avoid interruptive patterns
- **Data Collected**: We minimize data collection
- **Upsell Prompts Shown**: We avoid aggressive monetization

---

## Measurement Approach

### Analytics Stack
- Core events tracked: signup, upload, generation, playback, completion
- Privacy-first analytics (no PII, aggregate data only)
- Real-time dashboards for key metrics
- Weekly cohort analysis

### User Research
- Bi-weekly user interviews (5-10 users)
- Monthly surveys (NPS, feature requests)
- Usage pattern analysis
- Support ticket theme analysis

### A/B Testing Framework
- Test one variable at a time
- Minimum 1 week duration
- Statistical significance required (95% confidence)
- Focus on retention and engagement, not vanity metrics
